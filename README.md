# Ax100---Architecture
Overcomplicated, extendable ISA implemented in the game "Turing Complete".

[base ISA](https://github.com/SuperCraftAlex/Ax100---Architecture/blob/main/base-isa.md)

## Goals 
- 64 bit (in future also 32 bit)
- complex instructions for doing much things in only one clock cycle
- Easy to create a CPU with using the base core
- Multi core
- Extandability of the base ISA wich can be implemented in the CPU
- Reduced I/O usage
- Easy to create a system wich contains 1 - 8 CPUs wich should run 80% in parralel
- Implementation in TC
- Emulator written in Python
- Custom Asembler
- CPUs can have things like cache, fpus and other extensions

## Turing Complete Hardware

## Extensions
- Ax101 Cache system
- Ax102 Multi stream RAM
- Ax103 Register Blocks
- Ax104 Datatypes 1
- Ax105 FPU operations 1
- Ax106 Multi stream IO 
- Ax107 Advanced logic operations
