# Ax100---Architecture
Overcomplicated, extendable ISA implemented in the game Turinf Complete.

## Goals 
- 64 bit
- complex instructions for doing much things in only one clock cycle
- Easy to create a CPU with using the base core
- Extandability of the base ISA aich can be implemented in the CPU
- Reduced I/O usage
- Easy to create a system wich contains 1 - 8 CPUs wich should run 80% in parralel
- Implementation in TC
- Emulator written in Python
- Custom Asembler
- CPUs can have things like cache, fpus and other extensions
